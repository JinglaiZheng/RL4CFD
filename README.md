# RL4CFD
Bridging Reinforcement Learning with Computational Fluid Dynamics
# Purpose
I am going to use Pyfluent, GYM, StableBaseline3 and other libraries to implement RL and CFD interaction
# Backends
RL will be based on pure PYTHON language, CFD can be based on openform, fluent, COMSOL, Fenics platform, etc
# Research Direction
Any fluid dynamics optimization, control, inversion, etc
